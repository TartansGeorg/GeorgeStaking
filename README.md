# GeorgeStaking
Simple Solidity staking contract developed with brownie

This contract is a basic version of a staking contract. It allows users to stake their ethereum, and receive a custom ERC20 token as reward. This ERC20 token is pre-mined and distributted until the supply runs out.
It rewards one ERC20 token for each ethereum staked 1000 blocks.
